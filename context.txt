Goal: Build a Django-based product scraper for bathingbrands.com.

The project should:
- Scrape all products (title, description, price, images, SKU, brand, specs) from https://www.bathingbrands.com
- For each product, save the data in the Django database (Product model)
- Download all images and link them to each product
- Be easy to extend with export (CSV, eBay, Amazon, Shopify, etc.)
- Use requests and BeautifulSoup for scraping, unless JS rendering is needed
- Prioritize code clarity and reusability (functions/classes over scripts)
- Provide management commands or scripts to run scraping and exporting

Directory structure:
- context.txt (this file)
- bathing_scraper/ (project config)
- products/ (app: models, scraper, admin, exporters)
- media/ (for images)
- manage.py
